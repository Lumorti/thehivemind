### What is the hive mind?

A website allowing communication with "the hive mind", an entity whose responses are set by you. Each IP address can edit the response of any page once per day, to any text they want. See something you don't like? Change it, no account required.

### Won't people just be dicks?

I hope that on average people aren't dicks, but I understand that the page for "who should be president?" is going to be frequently changed and might sometimes be an extreme opinion from either side. I just hope the trolls are at least funny.

### Is this not dangerous? 

The only thing you can be attacked by is plain (i.e. non-script) text. But I undersand that "sticks and stones" is not true and words can indeed be hurtful, so if you see something that could seriously offend someone, I urge you to change it. If, as a programmer, you notice something in the code that could be exploited, please contact me.

### What data is stored?

The only "personal" data are salted hashes of the IPs that make changes, which are deleted each midnight GMT. Even if someone were to obtain these, they would not be able to revert it back to your IP address (unless they also have access to that day's salt and a supercomputer).

### Why is it called the "hive mind"?

When we look at a person, we don't see a collection of cells all working together, we see their combined efforts in the form of a single object. Humanity can also be seen as one entity, and we are to humanity as your cells are to you, a swarming mass of individual things which add up to something greater. Imagine being able to speak to humanity as a collective, as though asking questions to the "average" of every mind.

### How is this server being funded?

At the start, using my own money. If this becomes more popular and needs a larger server then I may add a donation link to this page. I do not intend to make any profit from this project, 100% of all donations will go towards hosting costs, you can hold me to that.
