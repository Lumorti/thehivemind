### What is the hive mind?

The hive mind is a website allowing communication with the hive mind, an entity whose responses are set by people. Each IP address can edit the response of any page once per day, to any text they want. See something you don't like? Change it, no account required, just a CAPTCHA.

### Won't people just be dicks?

I hope that on average people aren't dicks, but I understand that the page for "is Donald Trump a good person?" is going to be frequently changed and might sometimes be an extreme opinion from either side. I just hope the trolls are at least funny.

### Is this not dangerous? 

The only thing you can be attacked by is plain (non-script) text. But I undersand that "sticks and stones" is not true and words can be hurtful, so if you see something that could seriously offend someone, I urge you to change it.

### What data do you store?

The only "personal" data are hashes of the IPs that make changes, which are deleted each midnight GMT. Even if someone were to obtain these, they would not be able to get your IP address, all they would be able to do is check whether an IP address they already have matches the hash. 

### Why is it called the "hive mind"?

When we look at a person, we don't see a collection of cells all working together, we see their combined efforts in the form of a single object. Humanity is one entity, and we are to humanity as your cells are to you, a swarming mass of individual things which add up to something greater. An communication is a key part of that.
