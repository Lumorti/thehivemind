### What is the hive mind?

A website allowing communication with "the hive mind", an entity whose responses are set by you. Each IP address can edit the response of each question once per day, to any text they want. See something you don't like? Change it, no account required.

### Won't people just be dicks?

My hope is that (on average) people aren't too bad, but I understand that the page for "who should be president?" is going to be frequently changed and might sometimes be an extreme opinion from either side. I just hope the trolls are at least funny, although if you see something that could seriously offend someone, I urge you to change it. If, as a programmer, you notice something in the code that could be exploited, please contact me or open a GitHub issue.

### What data is stored?

The only "personal" data stored are salted hashes of the IPs that make changes, which are deleted each midnight GMT. The salts are also randomised daily, so even if someone were to obtain a hash, they would not be able to revert it back to your IP address.

### How is this server being funded?

At the start, using my own money. If this becomes more popular and needs a larger server then I may add a donation link to this page. I do not intend to make any profit from this project, 100% of all donations will go towards hosting costs, you can hold me to that.
